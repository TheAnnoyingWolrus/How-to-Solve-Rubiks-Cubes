                <h1 class="Titles">Brief history of the Cube</h1>
                <p class="ART-A">In the year of 1974 in a small town in the nation of Hungary, a young man was sitting in his office working on his priced project. It was four wooden cubes held together with elastic bands; eventually, he managed to make the cube hold itself together, slapped each side with its own colored stickers and experimented. Because of its simplicity, he scrambbled it. Unfortunately for him, he was gravely mistaken. It took him a whole month to learn how to solve his own puzzle. Once he actually solved it, he started selling the toys locally within Hungary. Eventually, this man received a sponsorship from a certain &trade;Ideal Toy Company. To make sure nobody steals his idea (which happened anyways), he requested for several patents on his new invention. Now that the Rubik's Cube was international, it became a worldwide trend and the world's most sold toy. This man is named Erno Rubik and he is the inventor of many other toys and puzzles that many kids have today.</p>

                 <h1>My Story</h1>
                 <p class="ART-A"><span>Back in my grade 5, I had a friend named Joseph. He loved to solve Rubik's Cubes. I was curious and decided to buy my own and ask him to "teach me his ways". He didn't know how to explain properly so I ended up searching tutorials for weeks, until I found the tutorial made by JPerm; this is when I truly learned and ended up solving my first Rubik's Cube. Now, as of June 2024, I am a pretty average speed-cuber passing on the knowledge of speed-cubing to people like you, dear reader.</span></p>
